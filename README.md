# WARRIOR-S-EYE-AUTONOMOUS-ROBOT-FOR-SITUATIONAL-AWARENESS-AND-SAFETY
In an ever-changing landscape of security threats, This project focuses on an innovative solution: an Autonomous War Field Surveillance Robot with Threat Detection. This intelligent robot combines technology from various domains, such as robotics, computer vision, and IoT, to improve battlefield awareness and safety.
The main aim of this project is to provide a low cost autonomous robot and to provide military forces with a reliable and adaptable ally that can navigate treacherous terrains and gather vital information. Equipped with an array of sensors, including cameras, microphones, GPS module and Magnetometer. It identifies suspicious activities, recognizes weapons, and instantly alerts the operators to critical events, such as explosions and gunfire.

Main components used are:
Arduino Uno
GPS sensor - NEO-6M GPS
Magnetometer - QMC5883L(Note: Can also be replaced with HMC5883L, if so... relevent libraries are available to use along with Arduino)
ESP-32 CAM module
Ultrasonic sensor
PIR Sensor
DC motor driver and DC motor

Here we have gone with CNN for image classification, We are using ResNet50 pretrained model and for the user interface a simple interface was built using kivy(python).
